## My Final Year Project

* All code can be found in `view-update/`


## Usage
* `stack run` should give a nice demo for the time being!


## TODO
* Move the gifsicle gif stiching into the haskell program.
* Make the graphing more generic?
* Add tests.
* Get a simple view update working on a Boolean algebra.
* Add documentation.
